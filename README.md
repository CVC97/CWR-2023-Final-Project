# Project 6: Model for the Spread of Infectious Diseases

Repository of Carlo von Carnap for the Final Project of the module *Computergest√ºtztes Wissenschaftliches Rechnen / Scientific Computing* during the summer semester 2023. The written report is found in the main folder under the name `spread_of_infection.pdf`.

## C-Code and makefile

The project includes the C-Code files
- `cvc_numerics.c`
- `cvc_rng.c`
- `spread_of_infection.c`

of which the latter one is the main program, while the former two are self-made libraries included via their respective header files. The repository possesses a `makefile` which comprises the following commands to complile and run the C-Code, as well as plot the generated `.csv` files:
- `make`
- `make run`
- `make plot`

## Plots

The necessary plots are generated by the `/soi_data/soi_plotting.py` file, executable by the above command. It uses the data files in the same folder and generates `.pdf` plots into the `/soi_data/visualizations` folder.

However, the plots are mainly part of the `spread_of_infection.pdf`.

## Animations

Several animations of the infectious spread simulation for various probability conditions can be found in the `/soi_animations` folder in form of `.mp4` video files.
