\subsection{Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) MT19937}\label{ssec:methodology_rng_mt19937}

For the generation of pseudorandom numbers, the 1997 developed PRNG Mer\-sen\-ne\,Twis\-ter MT19937\cite{Makoto_Takuji} was chosen. 
It was published in 1997 and has become one of the most popular PRNGs across programming languages.\cite{educativeMersenneTwister}

Its very long period with $2^{19937}-1$ integers as well as the fact that its random numbers are highly equidistributed\cite{MT_LearnCPP}, make the Mer\-sen\-ne\,Twis\-ter a very strong choice.
The Mersenne Twister broadly works by first taking a vector of $624$ random numbers as seed, then transforming it applying a ``twist'' operation and subsequently using it to retrieve the usable pseudorandom number. 
Once all integers of the state vector are consumed, the vector is regenerated.\cite{educativeMersenneTwister}\cite{MT_DavidWong}
