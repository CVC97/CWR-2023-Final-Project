\subsection{Use of the Libraries \texttt{cvc\_numerics.h} and \texttt{cvc\_rng.h}}

\subsection{Structure of the Main Program}

The above mentioned grid itself is realized as a $\left(L+2\right)\times \left(L+2\right)$ heap section of integer values, with $L$ being the sidelength of the quadratic grid where the actual spread of the infection takes place.
While this section is technically one-dimensional, it will for simplicity reasons be here refered to as a two-dimensional structure of the given shape. Inside the grid, the following integer values have been used 
to model the different states of the people within the simulation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{0:} this person is susceptible \textit{S} to the infection
    \item \textbf{1:} the person is infected \textit{I}
    \item \textbf{2:} the person is recovered \textit{R} and currently not susceptible
    \item \textbf{-1:} the person is vaccinated \textit{V} and does not participate in the spread
\end{itemize}
The grid has been implemented with an edge of ghosts at the top, bottom, left and right border, that are neither infectious nor subject to any updates of the grid --- they will permanently take the value \textbf{0}.
