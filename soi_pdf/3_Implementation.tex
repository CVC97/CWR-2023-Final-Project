\subsubsection*{Generation of Random Numbers by a Static RNG}

For the generation of pseudorandom numbers the in \prettyref{ssec:methodology_rng_mt19937} described Mersenne\,Twister MT19937 was used. It was implemented statically and can therefore be accessed
globally by the respective functions.

\subsubsection*{Implementation of the Modelling Grid}

The above mentioned grid itself was realized as a $\left(L+2\right)\times \left(L+2\right)$ heap section of integer values, with $L$ being the sidelength of the quadratic grid where the actual spread of the infection takes place.
While this section is technically one-dimensional, it will for simplicity reasons be here refered to as a two-dimensional structure of the given shape. Inside the grid, the following integer values were used 
to model the different states of the people within the simulation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{0}: this person is Susceptible \susceptible{} to the infection
    \item \texttt{1}: the person is Infected \infected{}
    \item \texttt{2}: the person is Recovered \recovered{} and currently not susceptible
    \item \texttt{-1}: the person is Vaccinated \vaccinated{} and does not participate in the spread
\end{itemize}
The grid was implemented with a supporting edge of ghosts at the top, bottom, left and right border, that are neither infectious nor subject to any updates of the grid --- they will permanently take the value
\texttt{0} and are irrelevant for the later visualization and analysis of the data.

\subsubsection*{Functions acting on the Modelling Grid}

In the main program all changes in the grid are facilitated by functions outside the main one. They entirely work with or change the grid in-place and all take the grid itself as well as its length $L+2$ as arguments.
Inside the functions, the grid is refered to as \texttt{grid}, its legth as \texttt{length} while the above probabilities are passed in form of the double array \texttt{probabilities}.
Excluding the ones to calculate the infection rate and its time average, none of the functions does have a return value. Overall the following functions can be called from the main:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{void print\_grid}: prints the grid
    \item \texttt{void grid\_init}: initializes the grid applying the vaccination probability
    \item \texttt{void update\_node}:
    \item \texttt{void grid\_update\_linear}:
    \item \texttt{void grid\_update\_stochastic}:
    \item \texttt{double ratio\_infected}:
    \item \texttt{double average\_ratio\_infected}:
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Structure of the Main Function and General Workflow}

The main function Each section of the main function is an enclosed space in order to prevent the variables from interfering with each other.

Overall a running time of around two minutes should be expected after the interactive part is finished.
