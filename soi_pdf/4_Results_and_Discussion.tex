\subsection{Time Development of the Expected Ratio of Infected People}

While previously the average of the ratio of infected individuals has been taken over time, the focus should now be layed on the time development of th einfection rate $\langle I\rangle_t$ for $N=20$ samples.
As grid size $L=64$ was chosen for appropriate balance between running time and accuracy, the number of simulation steps again was set to $T=1000$.
