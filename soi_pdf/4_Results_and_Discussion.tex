\section{Results and Discussion}

% \subsection{Model for the Spread of Infectious Diseases}

% The model was implemented in the previously described way and operates mainly by using a stochastic updating method for each timestep (i.e. $L^2$ random nodes are selected for actualization). 
% However, it is not expected to see a significant difference between the actualization schemes.

\subsection{Ratio of Infected People in the Grid Averaged over Time}

Aim was now to analyse the infection rate inside the grid averaged over all timesteps $\overline{\langle I\rangle}$ for different combinations of $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_2$. To achive this, the dependency of the 
turnover probability $p_1\left(\susceptible\rightarrow\infected\,\right)$ on the time-averaged infection rates was simulated for different combinations of $p_2\left(\susceptible\rightarrow\infected\,\right)$
and $p_3\left(\susceptible\rightarrow\infected\,\right)$. The simulation was performed over $T=1000$ simulation steps for each of the grid sizes $L=16$, $L=32$, $L=64$ and $L=128$.
%, the results are shown in \prettyref{fig:Res_Dis_Avg_Inf_over_p1}. 
The latter grid size $L=128$ is the largest one used for any simulation and still takes an acceptable but still non-negligable amount of calculation time.
Since this side length should provide more than fluctuation-resistant results and the calculation time more than doubles for a doubling in $L$, this was the maximum grid size trialed.

From looking at the results shown in \prettyref{fig:Res_Dis_Avg_Inf_over_p1} it immediately becomes visible that the lower grid sizes undergo stronger fluctuations in $\overline{\langle I\rangle}$ than the higher ones, 
with very strong deviations for $L=16$, particularly with $p_2=0.6$ and $p_3=0.3$. It is worth noting that the lower grid sizes only deviate towards smaller time-averaged infection rates and never towards higher ones. 
This can be explained by the underlying reason behind the deviations, which is not in fact primarily attributed to statistical fluctuations --- those are kept to a minimum due to averaging over time --- but
rather a secondary effect of the stochastic methods: the spread came to a halt after the number of infected individuals had fluctuated to zero at some point during the simulation. The occurance of these zeroed runs does
obviously happen more frequently with smaller grids, which can be confirmed using the manual updater at the beginning of the program and operating it with even lower grid sizes such as $L=8$.
Since the final time-averaged infection rate also correlates with the timestep where the spread eventually stopped, and earlier halts are more likely with lower infection rates, stronger outliers follow as more frequent 
for low infection rates as well. Consequently the simulation run with $p_2=0.6$ and $p_3=0.3$ and therefore the lowest $\overline{\langle I\rangle}$, also underwent the biggest changes from $L=16$ towards higher grid sizes.

    $p_2\left(\susceptible\rightarrow\infected\,\right)=0.3$ and $p_3\left(\susceptible\rightarrow\infected\,\right)=0.3$,

To further focus on the variations of $p_2$ and $p_3$ as well as the exact shape of the plotted curves, the time-averaged infection rates $\overline{\langle I\rangle}$ for the different probability combinations are 
shown together in \prettyref{fig:Res_Dis_Avg_Inf_over_p1_L128}. The plot only comprises the grid size $L=128$ for better visibility, while the biggest grid size was chosen for accuracy reason.

\subsection{Time Evolution of the Expected Ratio of Infected People}

While previously the average of the ratio of infected individuals has been taken over time, the focus should now be layed on the time development of th einfection rate $\langle I\rangle_t$ for $N=20$ samples.
As grid size $L=64$ was chosen for appropriate balance between running time and accuracy, the number of simulation steps again was set to $T=1000$.

    and standard deviation $\sigma_{\langle I\rangle_t}$ of the infection rate were calculated and are also displayed in the plot. The grid size was chosen as $L=64$, the turnover probabilities
    as $p_1=p_2=p_3=0.5$, no vaccinated induviduals were used.}\label{fig:Avg_Inf_over_t}
