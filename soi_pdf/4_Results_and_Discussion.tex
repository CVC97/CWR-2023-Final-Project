\subsection{Time Evolution of the Expected Ratio of Infected People}

While previously the average of the ratio of infected individuals has been taken over time, the focus should now be layed on the time development of th einfection rate $\langle I\rangle_t$ for $N=20$ samples.
As grid size $L=64$ was chosen for appropriate balance between running time and accuracy, the number of simulation steps again was set to $T=1000$.


\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\input{images/soi_infected_over_time.pgf}}
    \caption{Time evolution of the infection rate $\langle I\rangle_t$ over each of the $T=1000$ simulation steps for a total of 20 samples. At each timestep mean $\overline{\langle I\rangle_t}$
    and standard deviation $\sigma_{\langle I\rangle_t}$ of the infection rate were calculated and are also displayed in the plot. The grid size was chosen as $L=64$, the turnover probabilities
    as $p_1=p_2=p_3=0.5$, no vaccinated induviduals were used.}\label{fig:Avg_Inf_over_t}
